# Credit Approval Prediction
A website that predicts whether a loan will be accepted or rejected, based on User Input

## Objectives
In finance, a loan is the lending of money by one or more individuals, organizations, or other entities to other individuals, organizations etc. The recipient (i.e., the borrower) incurs a debt and is usually liable to pay interest on that debt until it is repaid as well as to repay the principal amount borrowed. In order to check the eligibility of the borrower, banks check few informations like Income, Age, Family Income etc. to confirm/reject the loan request. 
**Credit Approval Website** is prepared to assist any lending organization in properly checking all the data of the recipient and predict whether an individual is eligible for loan or not, based on past data.
